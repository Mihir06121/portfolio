        "body": `<p>Hey! I am Mihir Panchal currently in my last year pursuing my BSc.IT degree. Well if you want to know about me drop a message in the contact section. This is my first blog post and I am confused to choose the topic, so I decided to write on recent projects I am engaged with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s talk about the Todo application, this is a native application (mobile devices) where the users can create teams and assign tasks to their respective teams. Well, it sounds easy but as I started working on it, it is not as simple as it seems to be and also this is my first project on native app development. It’s been a month I guess starting this project, so far I have completed some modules like user authentication, creating a team, and a few more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, it was going smoothly, I successfully created user authentication and it went a little tricky for me to navigate users from auth modules to the todo dashboard, however, it also went nicely. Till now I encountered hundreds of errors whether it be compilation error, runtime error, syntax error, and many silly mistakes also got introduced to some new ones, but I have a ‘brahmastra’ for some bugs that seem to be impossible to solve. But I understood one thing you cannot be 100% perfect, you will encounter errors, and bugs and it has to be because, in the end, you will gain experience not in coding perfect but to solve errors, and fixing bugs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I guess I went off-topic, as I mentioned above that I completed a few modules and now struggling with a new bug. Here the bug is very simple to let me explain to you, I am logged in to the todo app and now I want to create a team, so I tapped the icon to create a team and I also successfully created it but the thing is while selecting the members from the list if I want to unselect the selected on I cannot do that, well I tried many solutions, used libraries, still working on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I end here to see you in another blog. Share this if you like it, and comment on your review on my first blog.</p><p><br></p>`,

        "slug": "BUG-SOLVED!-YET-MORE-COMING",
        "body": `<p>Today I have good news to share with you, remember the bug I posted in my first blog, well it has been a while as I was busy with some college stuff. So I was about to say good news that I solved the bug.</p><p><br></p><p>The solution to that was very simple, first, let me explain the bug once again. While creating a team user needed to select team members from the list of the users, and I was mapping the users using the FlatList component that is provided with react-native, so users can select the users but the issue was that the user cannot unselect the team-member once selected, this would be very annoying and would put bad impression for the app. So I went through various sites, and documentation and tried many more other possibilities, but didn’t work. Again next morning repeating the same process, while I was going through some documentation there I got triggered to search for libraries that do some stuff like multi-selecting elements. And there was my need for‘ react-native-multi-select’ this is the react-native library that maps the elements and enables to select and unselect items. Installed it and gave it a try, hoping it works fine, and this it worked flawlessly, and was able to complete the team-create module, also this package helped me with selecting a single user to assign a task. Thanks to the react-native developer's community for making really awesome and useful libraries.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the Todo-app is in a good state and progressing well. I added some more features to it like team members could discuss the assigned tasks with the team leader, it’s a kind of one-to-one chat. Yet there are some more changes to make like the discussion needs to only be visible to assigned-member and the team leader, other team members should not be able to read this discussion. Also, I want to add push notifications in this app, but I won’t be adding it in the beta release, well I tried to add a module to upload pdfs but it seems to be very buggy, or I am unable to integrate it efficiently. I would be releasing the beta v1 soon as I guess this build needs to be tested in the production mode and based on the responses I will improve the stability and efficiency of this app, which will also include push notifications and pdf upload in further beta versions.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, I guess it was getting more official, so I end here to see you in another blog. Share it if you like and comment on your review.</p>`,

        "body": `<p>Hey! Welcome back to my latest blog, I hope you guys are doing fine. The weather is clear now and it hasn't rained for 2 days, by the way, which season do you like the most post in the comment section below. Coming back to my Todo App, as I shared in the previous blog I wanted to add push notifications in that app.</p><p>& nbsp;</p><p>Well adding notifications in react-native is quite simple unless you are going for local notification i.e. no backend or server-side scripting needed for push notifications. So for implementing notifications in react-native, we need to install a package or library named ‘react-native-push-notification’, there are the various commands to install this but I mostly use ‘npm install’ for this used ‘npm install react-native-push-notification’ for notifications. A quick alert or warning or whatever you want to name it, always close the metro bundler which is running and then restart it by running the same command that you used to run the app; this is for whenever you install a new package in react-native.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well coming back to the notification part after installing the package make sure that you make the changes given in the documentation. Frankly speaking, I made ample mistakes doing these changes, so I recommend you read the documentation thoroughly. Then I went through some tutorial videos on YouTube, and other blog posts to get a better idea of how to use it. The implementation was easy for the local notification as I mentioned before, but for my app, I am looking to have notifications sent through the servers, for example, if a user creates a team so a notification needs to be sent to the users who were added to the team; here the problem arises. So for the server-side notifications, we need tokens that are specific to devices so that the notification will be sent to devices through the server. So the token is not a problem, the problem is how to allocate tokens in the database, whether I should put tokens in the existing userSchema or create a new collection for tokens. Another problem would come up if the user is using more than 1 account on the same device, so there will be the same tokens for different accounts. Well, I don’t know what would happen if this is the case as I don’t have many devices to test on so I would be restricting users not to having more than 1 account for the beta releases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I tried to put tokens in the existing userSchema but it didn’t work as expected, so I am working on the second possibility i.e. creating a collection for tokens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soon I will be posting the screenshots of the app in my landing page stay tuned, Share your views in the comment section down and share it if you like.&nbsp;</p>`,

        "body": `<p>Hey guys, how you are doing? Welcome to my new blog, as I mentioned in my last blog I will be posting the screenshots of the application but sorry for the delay as I was preparing for my exams, and today is my last paper. Yes, you would be thinking what time is it I am writing this blog it is almost 01:55 am now and my exam is at 11:45 am. I was a little bit tired and also I was feeling ‘sleeplessness’, I just googled this word, I was not getting any correct synonym.</p><p><br></p><p> Coming back to the topic as I also mentioned in my last blog about notifications, and their installation I also mentioned the problem I was facing to send notifications from my backend to devices. I got a breakthrough for this problem, and yes this is one of my biggest achievements.&nbsp;I figured out how to place the token in the database and as many possibilities would be possible to manipulate with tokens. Let’s take case no 1: user registers in the app while registration device token will also be pushed to the database along with the user credentials in user’s collections, now when the user logs in once more device token is pushed to the backend but this time it compares the token with the token in MongoDB if the token matches user will be logged in but if the token doesn’t match reasons would-be user is logging from another device, this time the token will be replaced by new token that new device has. Now can get notifications on devices that the user is currently logged in.</p><p><br></p><p>Case no 2: every time when device res tarts or an application is reinstalled a new token is generated so if the application is reinstalled case no 1 has a solution to it but if the device is restarted the device has a new token but the MongoDB has an old token the solution to this is very simple whenever the user opens the app the user gets authenticated automatically as the auth token is already stored in local storage so while the user is being authenticated there will be a post request to the server to match the token and replace it if doesn’t match. Well, it looks quite simple but the implementation is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with this I also worked on UI components and error handling some more changes made in libraries such as changes to the date picker package, fixed multiselect bugs for not showing icons, and many others.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way for the screenshots, you will soon get to see them. Share your views in the comment section down and share them if you like.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>`,

        "body": `<p>Finally, the first beta of TODO 2.0 is rolling out, you can check out the website ‘todo-20.netlify.app’ for more details and download it, well initially I was thinking to announce in my official website but later I changed my mind as I will be announcing the app once the stable beta is released, so hold on a little more soo n stable beta will be released.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>As of now, this beta is under testing, so you might be thinking that I hired a team just to test my application well that is true. These testers are quite professional and punctual, they are testing this application very precisely, recognizing every single mistake of and god knows what. I n return I will be giving them a treat, yes just a treat they don’t deserve more than that, the famous team is none other than my friends.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>So the beta is released now let's talk about the further changes I will be adding, I guess the major changes will be for UI in authentication flow to be specific. I will be adding in put of email on the splash screen, the user will enter their email-id and the back-end will search for the user based on that email, if the user exists then it will be directed to the login page where he will be asked for a password, if the user doesn’t exist then it will be directed to register screen to get itself registered. Further UI changes will be for form elements, for now, I am using ‘react-native-elements’ for basic styled UI components, but for forms, I will switch to ‘react-native-paper’. Need dozen of improvements for the ‘Create Todo screen’, as for now, it is a bit confusing for the end-user to figure out. I Will also include group discussion in the team, well this is going to take time as first I will implement socket.io for a chat. And one more thing I found a bug that the team members are able to see the chats between the individual team member and team leader, so need to fix this before socket.io.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>OK, so far these were few UI changes, now coming to major changes, implementing this will change the working of the application. Let me explain this first, now the list on the ‘Create Todo screen’ are all the users registered in the app as far as testing and small-scale use this may work but once it is globally available there will be ‘n’ numbers of users so to tackle this situation user will register in this application along with their mobile number. This would work similarly to What's App, users will be listed the list of the user that has registered and exist in their contacts. This would help the user to create the team as they don’t need to go through the whole list every time.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Hope you like the blog, share your comments below. See you soon in my next blog.</p><p><br></p>`,

        "body": `<p>Hey guys, how are you? Hope you are fine. It has been almost 4 months since I posted my last blog “TODO 2.0!!!! Not Complete Yet”, as I was busy with my project stuff and college events. Also want to make an announcement, that there is an awesome fest coming in Feb dates are 16th to 17th. This is a 3-day fest organized by students of the IT and CS department of my college, you can visit the website of the fest for more info ‘https://technovafest.netlify.app’, here you can get information about the fest also the registration link for the same is present in this website so checkout and do register as this is fest organized for the students by the students.</p><p>&nbsp;< /p><p>Now, I am out of topics to discuss, that’s the main problem with me when I get into a conversation with someone suddenly I get blank and confused like what to talk next maybe that is the reason I don’t have more friends to talk to or it’s something else..... I don’t know. By the way, I also tried dual-booting Debian-based OS on my laptop, first t I dual-booted Ubuntu successfully. It was not that easy for dual booting as I was about to delete windows 11 on my laptop, but I thank the online forums and also the tutorial videos which helped me dual boot successfully. I must say that I really loved Ubuntu also there were problems initially like I was not able to use my Nvidia graphic card installed on the laptop also installing the drivers for the same was really a pain. But somehow I managed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I used Ubuntu for at least 4 months and I don’t know why I felt like switching to another OS, it's not like Ubuntu didn’t meet my expectations instead I would say Ubuntu is the best first step for those who are trying L Linux for the first time. It has a nice clean UI and desktop, simple installation for first-time users. So the thing is that I just wanted to try some other distros based on Linux, and now I am using Zorin Os 16 core edition. I must say this distro is really cool and also has some really cool stuff to play around with. I am using this distro for my day-to-day tasks and also for programming, this distro is based on Ubuntu LTS 20.04 I guess. I am been using this for the last few days and have no complaint, it is really smooth for day-to-day tasks, also as it is built on top of Ubuntu it uses Debian package manager and also can use apt to get updates. The installation is also simple and similar to Ubuntu. Here the UI is much similar to windows, not the whole UI just the desktop layout. You can change the layout as per your choice, it has a few layouts similar to macOS also but it is not in the core you need to buy Zorin Os 16 pro edition, well I am using the core edition which is free there is also a lite version for low-performance PC or very very low-performance PC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And one more thing, I will be starting with a desktop application for TODO 2.0 soon after I make some improvements in the mobile application. So I end here will see you soon in another blog, till then take care and share your experience with any of the Linux distros in the comments below .</p>`,
